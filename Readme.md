# INSTALLATION

## Preferred configuration

I've found that some window managers (e.g. Enlightenment) will clobber
/etc/alternatives/x-window-manager, so it's easiest to get x11-leet working
when there are no X packages installed on the system.

During installation of Debian Jessie, when the "Software selection" screen
comes up, uncheck the following:

* Debian desktop environment
  * ... GNOME
  * ... xfce
  * ... KDE
  * ... Cinnamon
  * ... MATE
  * ... LXDE

## In general

To install x11-leet:

    git clone https://github.com/alfiedotwtf/x11-leet
    cd x11-leet
    make install

Once installed, reboot :)
